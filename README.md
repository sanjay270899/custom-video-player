## About Project

I have built a react video player with custom controls. One can search and add videos by a key word. All fetched videos will be shown in video queue.

### Task:

Create a video player with custom controls like one below.

1. You can either have it play a YouTube video or local video (pick one of them).
2. When `hovering` over the video it should `show just the controls`.
3. When user `pauses` the video it should `show the title, channel name, video views and description of video (3 lines only)`.
4. The controls and details should auto hide after certain time.
5. Use emojis in your git commit message

- Clean code and structure is top priority.

### Bonus points for:

These are just for you to try out, it wont be held against you if you decide to not do these.

- Showing a queue next to the player.
- Adding responsive layout for mobile.
- Adding option for user to load a playlist/video.
