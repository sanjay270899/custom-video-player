### Task:

Create a video player with custom controls like one below.

1. You can either have it play a YouTube video or local video (pick one of them).
2. When `hovering` over the video it should `show just the controls`.
3. When user `pauses` the video it should `show the title, channel name, video views and description of video (3 lines only)`.
4. The controls and details should auto hide after certain time.
5. Use emojis in your git commit message
- Clean code and structure is top priority.
